# SUBMISSION 2, OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING IN JAVA
Goal
In Assignment 2, you make a program with object-oriented programming and data structures in Java.

# Description
You should make an application where you can store information (which is saved as long as the program is running, not with permanent data). You choose the theme yourself, eg film, music, books, contacts, members.

The program does with object-oriented design. Data structures are made with ArrayList (and possibly arrays). There should be a menu where you make the choices that the program should make.

The input is made with the Scanner class. The assignment must be done individually.
There is a menu when the program starts, and which you can access during the program. For example, use numbers to make choices.
The program must have an object-oriented design with classes, objects, inheritance (inheritance). The classes must have a structure with private variables (Encapsulation) where possible and access from other classes with eg goat and set methods.
You should use ArrayList for data structure.
You should at least be able to add and view data.
You must plan how the program will work, which classes (super and subclasses) will be included.
A brief planning must be submitted at the same time as the application. The planning must also be presented to the teacher during the work with the assignment.
You must use Javadoc in your documentation code.
Requirements for VG
In addition to the basic task:

You should think of your own functionality in the program that adds something to the use of the program. You should use object-oriented design (eg inheritance, interface) to solve it.
In addition to planning the application (for G), you must also submit a description of your own functionality and examples of how you arrived at the solution. The purpose of your own functionality must also be shown to the teacher while working on the assignment.
