# SUBMISSION 1, DICE GAMES IN JAVA
Goal
In Assignment 1, you make a dice game as a console application in Java.

# Description
You will make a dice game where you play against the computer. The game is about showing points for each roll for both the player and the computer and who won the game. You should be able to run a new game as long as the application is up. (You can expand the functionality such as a simple Yatzy if you want.)

You should be able to make entries through the Scanner class. You should use loops, if sets and arrays when making the application. You will structure your code, use methods, and name variables based on what we have gone through in the course.

The assignment must be done individually.

Grading criteria

In addition to the basic task:

You should also be able to choose the number of players (then you can choose to exclude the computer as a player).
You should make a high-score list that is saved in an array.
