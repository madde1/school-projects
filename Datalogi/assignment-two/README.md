# Introduction
A prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and can only be divided by 1 or a positive version of itself. For example, 2, 3 and 5 are prime numbers.

The program will work with prime numbers, sorts and searches.
The program will need a data structure that you work with. Which data structure you choose is up to you.
What is behind (Extra) is not necessary for a passing grade, but significantly increases the chances of a passing grade.
Program
Initially, the program should display three options, "Add", "Sort" and "Search". After specifying a selection, it will run the following:

Add run: a) b) c) d)
Type of drive: e)
Search runs: f)
After this, the program should return to the initial mode. The mode must have some way to end the program and it must be displayed to the user.

Add:

a) Create an input field that is saved in a String. An alternative can be an inputDialog. This field must be able to receive all forms of input but only approve inputs of type int. If the type is not an int, the program should return to the input field.
b) The program must now check the input given if it is a prime number that has been specified. If so, the program should save the number in a new location in your data structure.
c) Now the program must also check if inputs to be inserted into the data structure already exist. If this is the case, the program should not enter the specified value but instead notify the user: "The given input already exists".
d) The program must now add all the values ​​in the data structure and place the sum in a variable. The variable must be checked if it is a prime number. If so, it should be inserted in a new location in your data structure. (Extra) If a new value is inserted, the process must be repeated.
Variety:

e) The program shall sort the data structure via a separate method. A printout of the data structure must be made before and after sorting. (Extra) Bubble type must not be used. Leave a comment inside the program which sort you use.
Search:

f) A search box should now be displayed to the user. Upon input, the program must check whether the given value is in the data structure. If it finds the value, it should show it to the user through "X was found". If it does not find the value, it should instead give the response "X was not found". (Extra) In addition, if it does not find the specified value, it should instead reproduce the nearest value that exists, if there are values ​​in the data structure.
(Extra)

g) Increase the number of options in your initial mode to four options. The new option should ask how many new prime numbers the user wants to find and only receive int of type int in their input field. The program must then find the highest value in the data structure and look for x new prime numbers with a higher value and insert these into the data structure.
