# Task
You must build a program that meets the following requirements:

1. It must be possible to enter text that is saved in the program.
2. It should be possible to retrieve saved text by searching for either content or place in a data structure. Both types are not needed.
3. It should be possible to change a text and save it.
4. It should be possible to delete saved text.
5. The program must have a sorting function.
6. Each time a text is saved in the program, a data structure must add a number to a separate data structure. The number added here should come from the fibonaxis number sequence. Thus, the first numbers to be added are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and so on.
7. At each new number (X) entered into the data structure, the program must calculate whether x is an even or odd number.
8. The program must be functional.
9. The program must contain at least one recursive method.
10.The (Extra) program must include the ability to encrypt a text. The encryption can be done as you wish. An example is to change all letters to two characters later, eg A becomes C, D becomes F, etc.
11. (Extra) The sort function must now have at least two different settings for how the text that has been saved is to be sorted.
12. (Extra) The program must be able to calculate the number of words that have been saved in total.
13. (Extra) Text saved must have a link to the date.
14. (Extra) Build on at least one additional optional feature.
